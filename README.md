This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of innerHTML in HTML. The bug showcases how incorrectly using innerHTML to add elements with nested elements can lead to unexpected behavior. Event handlers attached to nested elements may not work correctly. The solution shows how to use the DOM manipulation methods(appendChild, createElement) to properly add elements and avoid this issue.
